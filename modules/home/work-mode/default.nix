        #     "splash", "dialog", "normal", "dropdown_menu", "popup_menu",

        # Following per window-type options are available: ::
        #
        #   fade, shadow:::
        #     Controls window-type-specific shadow and fade settings.
        #
        #   opacity:::
        #     Controls default opacity of the window type.
        #
        #   focus:::
        #     Controls whether the window of this type is to be always considered focused.
        #     (By default, all window types except "normal" and "dialog" has this on.)
        #
        #   full-shadow:::
        #     Controls whether shadow is drawn under the parts of the window that you
        #     normally won't be able to see. Useful when the window has parts of it
        #     transparent, and you want shadows in those areas.
        #
        #   redir-ignore:::
        #     Controls whether this type of windows should cause screen to become
        #     redirected again after been unredirected. If you have unredir-if-possible
